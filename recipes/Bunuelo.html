    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds of yucca</li>
        <li>1/2 pound brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 pound dry cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 liter oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>2 Cinnamon sticks</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash the yucca and peel it, then split it to grate it along with the cheese.</li>
        <li>Then add the baking powder and leave it at rest for about 10 to 12 minutes</li>
        <li>Once the time is over, start forming the balls.</li>
        <li>We light our fire and pour oil into our casserole and when it is very hot we fry them.</li>
        <li>The idea is that the balls are submerged so that the bark is fried to perfection.</li>
        <li>Once they look golden, we take out with a spoon, drain the oil and then serve it.</li>
    </ol>
