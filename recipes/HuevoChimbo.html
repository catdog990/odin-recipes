            <h3>Description</h3>

            <p>
                Huevo chimbo, huevo quimbo, tajadon, tajadon de Trujillo, huevos reales… 
                there are many names for this traditional dessert from the XVI century. We inherited this recipe from Spanish nuns, who were experts in the preparation of many sweets. 
                These talented ladies found in this dessert a delicious way to make good use of leftover egg yolks that ended up in the kitchen after making meringues and many other puddings with the whites. Egg whites were also put to good use, and there are even stories that claim that they were used to make cement to build churches.

                The original recipe for huevo chimbo came from Spain, and these nuns spread it all over Latin America; that is why it’s known from Mexico to Chile, with similar names, and only slight variations in the preparation. 
                In Nicaragua, however, huevos chimbos is a completely different thing, but I believe this is the only exception.
